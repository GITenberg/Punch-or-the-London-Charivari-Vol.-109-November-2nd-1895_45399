<h2>THE MINISTER OF FINE ARTS.</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>From a Newspaper of the Future.</i>)</p>

<p>Many years ago, in 1895, our esteemed contemporary, the <i>Daily
Graphic</i>, suggested the appointment of a Minister of Fine Arts.
This seemingly admirable scheme was soon after carried out. The
first Minister was a cautious man. His one great improvement,
which met with universal approval, was to remove all the statues
and fountains from every part of London, and to place them in a row
on Romney Marsh, from Dungeness to Hythe, where they would
undoubtedly scare away any French army endeavouring to land.
The second Minister tried to introduce the so-called "Queen Anne,"
or Dutch architecture, and prepared a scheme for altering the whole
of London. As a beginning, the north side of Oxford Street, from
Holborn to the Marble Arch, was completely transformed. Along
the whole distance stretched a fantastic row of red-brick buildings,
the surface of which was diversified at every possible point by useless
little windows, and little arches, and little projections, and little
recesses, and little balustrades. These had risen to the level of the
second floors, when a change of Government brought in a Minister
who believed only in English architecture of the fifteenth century.
Under his directions the new buildings were therefore continued in
stone, in imitation of the Houses of Parliament, but the work was
stopped by his death. His successor, though of course one of the
Gothic party, preferred the Gothic architecture of Italy, and the
upper parts of the houses were therefore finished in that style.
As at that time the reduction of the Budget was urgently needed,
it was decided to use painted stucco instead of real marble, as in
Italy.</p>

<p>When the next Government came into office all the houses on the
South side of Oxford Street were pulled down, and everyone said
that at last we should have an imposing row of buildings. Unfortunately
a difficulty arose. The new Minister of Fine Arts was
only interested in gardening, and hardly knew one style of architecture
from another. He could not therefore decide the great
question whether the new houses should correspond with the opposite
ones, and, if so, whether they should be "Queen Anne," or Italian
Gothic, or English Perpendicular in style. The controversy raged
for months. Every person interested said, or wrote, what he
thought, or knew, or did not think, or did not know, about architecture,
and taste, and art in general. The Academy of Arts, the
Society of Antiquaries, and the Institute of Architects, hitherto
sedate bodies, became so excited that free fights occurred almost daily
in the neighbourhood of Burlington House, and on the waste land in
Oxford Street. In every newspaper "The Improvement of Oxford
Street" was discussed vigorously. Suddenly the current of public
opinion was turned in another direction by a lamentable event. The
Minister of Fine Arts, returning from his weekly inspection of the
maiden-hair ferns on Wormwood Scrubs, was killed in a cab accident
in Vigo Street, a miserably narrow turning, which had escaped the
notice of everyone but the cabmen, who always prefer the narrowest
streets.</p>

<p>At once there arose a universal cry that safety and space were more
important than style. The new Minister was beginning to widen
some of the narrow thoroughfares, when his party went out of office.
The work has not been continued by the present Minister, who is
considering a scheme for the improvement of London by the erection
of fountains and statues. Meanwhile the Oxford Street site is still
vacant, and no improvements are attempted elsewhere. Half of
Vigo Street has been made the same width as Burlington Gardens;
the other half remains, as before, about fifteen feet across from
house to house.</p>

<p>Our esteemed contemporary, the <i>Daily Graphic</i>, always alive to
the artistic needs of the age, remarks that it is impossible to regulate
art by Acts of Parliament, or to improve London by party government,
and therefore suggests that the Ministry of Fine Arts should
be abolished.</p>

<h2>SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Board and Residence.</span>&mdash;Here is a gem from the Bandon Quarter
Sessions. Their Medical Officer of Health, Dr. <span class="sc">Magner</span>, was suing
the Guardians of the Clonakilty Union for failing to erect a fence
round the Dispensary residence:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
Counsel argued that the true cause of all this was that Dr. <span class="sc">Magner</span>
happened to be a gentleman of independent mind, who had not, like others
in the same position, the <i>savoir faire</i> to cuddle guardians.</p>

<p><i>His Honour.</i> Do you mean to say that any unfortunate medical officer has
to cuddle boards of guardians? A very unpleasant duty certainly.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Powell.</i> Well, they had to attend the meetings, and, perhaps, stand
drinks, and things of that kind. (<i>Laughter.</i>)
</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem width24">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Who would not be such a Medical Officer,</p>
<p class="i2">Practised in keeping his Board well in hand?</p>
<p>D'you think that he offers them cocoa or coffee, Sir?</p>
<p class="i2">No; but it's whisky he's called on to "stand."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Paupers fall ill, and his task is to cure 'em;</p>
<p class="i2">In fights with infection he comes up to time;</p>
<p>'Gainst bad sanitation he's paid to secure 'em;</p>
<p class="i2">His drains may be poor, but his "drinks" must be prime.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Is any Guardian cantankerous? He "cuddles" him</p>
<p class="i2">(So did a Counsel obscurely declare);</p>
<p>And should this fail, then his "Irish hot" fuddles him;</p>
<p class="i2">For what is a doctor without "<i>savoir faire</i>"?</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p><span class="sc">The Water-Bandits again!</span>&mdash;Not content with spoiling the
Falls of Foyers, the Aluminium Company now threatens an attack
on the Falls of Clyde. Oh, what a Fall is there, my countrymen!
exclaims the patriotic Scot. The Co. that dares to lay its hands on
Clyde, save in the way of kindness, is a willun, and should be wound
up instanter. Says the <i>North British Daily Mail</i>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
The times are distinctly utilitarian and prosaic, and yet we have not all
progressed up, or down, to the level of the man who sees nothing in a grand
cataract beyond so much horse-power running to waste.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Neatly put, and even from a utilitarian standpoint it may be well
to remember that as much money may be brought into Scotland by a
thousand tourists wanting to view the Falls, as by a single company
wanting to ruin them.</p>

<h2>LETTERS FROM A FIANCÉE.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">My dear Marjorie</span>,&mdash;Since I wrote to
you last, <span class="sc">Arthur</span> has developed unmistakable
signs of acute jealousy. <i>Bluebeard</i>
was mild in comparison with him; <i>Othello</i>
childishly unsuspicious. At first, I liked it,
and was flattered; but it is now beginning to
be a little wearing. Also, I find that it has
the effect of making me ridiculously and
unjustifiably vain; catching, as it were, from
<span class="sc">Arthur</span>, the idea that everyone I meet must
necessarily admire me, and would like to take
his place. A quite absurd instance of this has
just happened, of which I am rather ashamed.
My cousin <span class="sc">Freddy</span>, who is staying with us
in the country, has a musical friend, called
<span class="sc">Percival</span>, for whose talents and accomplishments
<span class="sc">Freddy</span> has the greatest possible admiration.
Having got permission to bring
him down, <span class="sc">Freddy</span> instantly dragged him to
the piano and insisted on his playing and
singing a song which went like this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width15">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"The people call me <span class="sc">Daisy</span>,</p>
<p>Little <span class="sc">Daisy</span>, with the dimple,</p>
<p>And all the boys are fond of me</p>
<p>Because I am so simple," &amp;c.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>We were all charmed, except <span class="sc">Arthur</span>, and
except <span class="sc">Percival</span> himself. <span class="sc">Percival</span> composes
songs, called "<i>Dreaming Eyes</i>," "<i>Far
from Thee</i>," "<i>Ever</i>"; besides, he can play
<span class="sc">Wagner</span>, and <span class="sc">Mascagni</span>, and <span class="sc">Tosti</span>, and all
kinds of real classical music, and didn't quite
like to be treated as if he were a mere music-hall
singer. He is a gentle, amiable creature,
without any pose, and with (as I know <i>now</i>)
not the very smallest intention or desire to
steal the heart of one who belonged to another.
It would be difficult to find anyone less likely
than <span class="sc">Percival</span> to break up&mdash;let us say, for
instance, a happy English home. <span class="sc">Arthur</span>
thought otherwise; to <span class="sc">Arthur</span>, <span class="sc">Percival</span>
seemed a <i>Don Juan</i>, a gay <i>Lothario</i>, a very
<i>Lovelace</i>, the most dangerous of young troubadours.
And he glared&mdash;really, glared is
the only word&mdash;so much while I talked to
poor young <span class="sc">Percival</span> that I, also, actually
began to think there must be something in
it; and, from mischief, I talked to him the
more. After dinner, we danced. To tease
<span class="sc">Arthur</span>, who was snubbing everyone and
looking sulky, I couldn't resist sitting in the
conservatory a little while with <span class="sc">Freddy's</span>
friend. True, my conversation with this
reckless <i>Rizzio</i> might have been, word for
word, carried on between two provincial old
ladies: and yet, the knowledge that <span class="sc">Arthur</span>
wouldn't have believed it, gave a sort of
imaginary romantic wickedness to the whole
thing. He asked me if I had read <i>Trilby</i>,
and said he had, curiously enough, never
seen the <i>Shop Girl</i>. We agreed, that though
we didn't much like the winter, still it was
certainly a nice change after the summer.
We had reached this point, when <span class="sc">Arthur</span>
came into the conservatory; I rose, so did
<span class="sc">Percival</span>, and at the same time he handed
me a little piece of paper on which he had,
while he talked, been writing something in
pencil.... I walked away with <span class="sc">Arthur</span>,
mechanically squeezing the little bit of paper
in my hand.</p>

<p>"What," he said, furiously, "was that
letter that young fool gave you?"</p>

<p>Becoming frightened, I denied that he had
given me a letter, slipped it into my mouth,
and slowly ate it.... We had a scene. I
cried; we made it up, and he gave me a new
brooch afterwards.</p>

<p>The next day I seized an opportunity to
tell <span class="sc">Percival</span> that he <i>mustn't</i> do such things,
as it made <span class="sc">Arthur</span> very angry, and also to
ask what was on the piece of paper. He
looked at me. "Why, Miss <span class="sc">Gladys</span>," he
said, "didn't you show it to your future
husband?"</p>

<p>"What was it?" I asked, timidly.</p>

<p>"It was my publisher's address. You said
you would like to have some of my songs,
and&mdash;&mdash;" Thank heaven, he has gone away
now, and as <span class="sc">Freddy</span> is always cycling, there
is peace again.</p>

<p>But advise me what to do about <span class="sc">Arthur</span>.</p>

<p><i>The Chronicles of Count Antonio</i>, by <span class="sc">Anthony Hope</span>. "Delightful,"
quoth the Baron; all colour laid on artistically, yet in
bold slap-dash style. Broad effects as in scene-painting. He is the
Sir <span class="sc">John Gilbert</span> of romancers is Count <span class="sc">Antonio Hope Hawkins</span>
The <i>beau cavalier</i> wins his lady against
all odds. It is <span class="sc">Walter Scott</span>, <span class="sc">G. P. R.
James</span>, <span class="sc">Lever</span>, <span class="sc">Ainsworth</span>, <span class="sc">Dumas</span>,
Drury Lane drama, ancient Astley's Amphitheatre,
essenced; the whole thing
done in one readable volume! Genuine
romance: all "movement": interest
never allowed to flag: drums, alarums,
excursions: obstacles everywhere only
to be surmounted: dramatic finish and
final tableau magnificent! Curtain:
loud applause: and calls for author.
Great success.</p>

<p>Hugely content is the Baron with a
book published by <span class="sc">Smith, Elder &amp; Co.</span>,
and writ by one "<span class="sc">Jack Easel</span>," some
time a frequent contributor to <i>Mr.
Punch's</i> pages. The title of the work
is "<i>Our Square and Circle</i>." All is
written "on the square," and that the
matter is "non-contentious" is evident, as otherwise the author
would be "arguing in a circle," which is absurd; or "in a vicious
circle," which would of course utterly take away the reputation of
his quiet square for eminent respectability. That it is pleasantly
written, the reader will find out for himself; that it was a labour of
love, and therefore Easel-y writ, goes without saying. The Baron
joins issue with him on certain details as to the table, the wines, and
dinners generally; though up to now he should have thought himself
at one with him [or "at 7.45 with him," which is the more likely
hour] on all such important points. The Baron gives the book his
"Imprimatur," says "Pass <span class="sc">Jack Easel</span>," and is the author's and

<h2>PLEASURE AND PROFIT.</h2>

<p class="center1c">[It has recently been suggested in the <i>Author</i> that novelists should take
the management of their books entirely into their own hands.]</p>

<p>Happening to call lately on my friend <span class="sc">Snooks</span>, the eminent
novelist, I was rather surprised at the change which had come over
the appearance of his drawing-room. The books, which had been
scattered over the table in former days, were now methodically
arranged along the shelves which covered the entire walls, and in
the corner, where a china cabinet had formerly stood, there now
figured a sort of counter, behind which stood <span class="sc">Snooks</span> himself,
arrayed in his shirt-sleeves.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he exclaimed, as I entered, "what can I have the pleasure
of showing you to-day? Romances, poetry, travels&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, <span class="sc">Snooks</span>," I said, "don't you remember me? What on
earth are you doing?"</p>

<p><span class="sc">Snooks's</span> face fell somewhat. "Oh, it's you, is it? I thought
it was a customer. You see that I've taken the <i>Author's</i> advice,
and am managing my own affairs."</p>

<p>"Indeed? And how in the world&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" the novelist interrupted. "Here are some customers."
And as he spoke four or five people entered the drawing-room, and
marched up to the counter.</p>

<p>"A nice novel, Madam," said <span class="sc">Snooks</span>, just like one of Messrs.
<span class="sc">Marshall and Snelgrove's</span> young men. "Certainly. Kindly
step this way, please. Here is my <i>Love's Dilemma</i>, very sweet, I
assure you. Yes, only four-and-six cash. Thank you.... Can I
show you anything, Sir? This is in the latest style&mdash;<i>The Decree
Nisi</i>&mdash;or I could write you something to order, if you prefer it....
Hymns, Madam? No, I am afraid I've none in stock, would a
devotional sonnet do? Of course, I could make any number you
require at the shortest notice.... Thank you, seven-and-sixpence
change. They shall be delivered to-morrow morning. Evangelical,
I think you said?... To suit a young lady&mdash;<i>not</i> advanced?
Certainly, Sir; I can offer you my <i>Milk and Mayblossom</i>, published
at six shillings; reduced to half-a-crown.... You didn't like
<i>Murder and Sudden Death</i>, Sir? Well, I <i>am</i> surprised, it's one of
my favourite productions; but I can sell you a rather milder blend,
if you prefer it."</p>

<p>And so the conversation went on, until all the customers had been
satisfied, and <span class="sc">Snooks</span> wiped his heated brow and turned to me.
"There, you see how it works; splendid system, isn't it? No
trouble with publishers or booksellers, entirely a ready-money trade,
done over the counter in one's own drawing-room."</p>

<p>"Then all these books are your own work?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Of course; you don't suppose I'm fool enough to sell other
people's goods? Of course I keep a large ready-made stock, and
turn out others to order as required. And, as you're here, do just
buy&mdash;&mdash;" At this point I fled.</p>

<h2>SPORT PER WIRE.</h2>

<p class="center1">[An international revolver match by cable is arranged to take place shortly
between English and American teams.]</p>

<p>"Good morning," said a representative of <i>Mr. Punch</i> to the
Chief Umpire of a well-known Telegraphic Agency; "I have come
to ask if you would kindly favour me with some details of your
new Sporting Department."</p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied. "It has a great future before it. We
intend to revolutionise sport in all its branches."</p>

<p>"For instance?"</p>

<p>"Well, as it's in season, take Football. In fact, I've just
finished umpiring in an Association
match between England and America,
which, in my unofficial capacity, I'm
happy to say we've won&mdash;for a change."</p>

<p>"Where was it played?"</p>

<p>"Why, at this desk, of course. You
see, <i>we</i> cable over to the Associated Press
full particulars of the imaginary kick-off,
and they look it out in the Code&mdash;which
doesn't generally take more than
ten minutes&mdash;and wire back their return
kick (also imaginary), with name, age,
weight, and address of the kicker. This
is generally repeated as a security against
the risk of error. The charge for repetition
is one-half the charge for transmission,
any fraction of one penny less
than a halfpenny being reckoned as one
halfpenny, according to the admirable
wording of the Post Office rules."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 180px;"><a href="images/209b-420.png"><img src="images/209b-180.png" width="180" height="274" alt="Football" /></a></div>

<p>"We wrangle for the rest of the time. This is quite in keeping
with the modern spirit of football, the game now having developed
into a kind of Hibernian debating society."</p>

<p>"But how was it you won to-day?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we had the last word before 'Time' was called, which enabled
our Sporting Editors to prove conclusively that the first kick scored a
goal, and was not 'offside.' Our American colleagues, however, have
appealed to the Central International Committee of Football Referees,
so that the wires will be kept warm for the next half-year on the
subject in the most sportsman-like manner."</p>

<p>"Capital! And have you any other telegraphic developments?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes! There's our Ladies Inter-Varsity Stay-at-Home Hockey
Contest&mdash;that's played over there in the corner every afternoon by
sixpenny telegram. The Dramatic and Novelist Editors attend to
that, in order to acquaint themselves with the workings of the feminine
mind. The Golf Department is in charge of the Scottish Editors.
They have an anxious time of it, as most of the language used is
not fit for transmission, and bunker them badly.... That's the
River Editor, hard at work in that arm-chair, rowing against Yale
by cable. And there you see our Racing Authority, busily engaged
over a Horseless Derby with the French Staff.... My Second-in-Command
is now arranging the Corbett-Fitzsimmons fight, which
will take place at last by telegraph on opposite sides of the Atlantic....
We do a bit of Comic Volunteer Man&oelig;uvres as well, but I'm
sorry to say that our Shouting Editor, whose idea of humour is somewhat
noisy, has just broken the telephone with one of his ejaculations....
But I must ask you to excuse me now, as I have a
billiard tournament, a yacht race, and a cricket match with all
Australia to manage simultaneously, and the spectators&mdash;I mean
newspaper readers&mdash;are getting impatient."</p>

<h2>THE MUSIC HALL AS OTHERS WOULD SEE IT.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>With compliments to those it may concern</i>)</p>

<p>The <i>entrepreneur</i> had conducted, the visitor
here, there, and everywhere. He had shown
the stage, the auditorium, and the tea and
cake-room. Every feature of the reformed
scheme had been duly explained.</p>

<p>"No singing allowed in the entertainment?"
queried the visitor.</p>

<p>"None at all," was the reply; "we consider
that music is a mistake. Of course
same songs are good, but as others are bad
it is better to prohibit them altogether, and
thus escape the risk of a mistaken choice."</p>

<p>"And no dancing?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. That would be entirely
contrary to our principles. If people require
exercise they can walk or run."</p>

<p>"But how about the poetry of motion?
How about the grace of movement?"</p>

<p>"We desire to have nothing to do with
either," returned the <i>entrepreneur</i>. "You
see our object is to have an entirely new
entertainment, and consequently we reject
all items, that have figured in other programmes."</p>

<p>"Well, well," murmured the visitor;
"you may be right. But I should like to
see the result. I will wait until the performance
is given, and judge for myself."</p>

<p>"I am sorry I cannot assist you to carry
out this scheme," declared the Manager of
the Progressive Music Hall, "because we are
not going to have an entertainment."</p>

<p>"No, of course not. Of course it won't be
an entertainment in the usual sense of the
word. It can't naturally be an entertainment&mdash;I
should have said a performance."</p>

<p>"But we give neither entertainment nor
performance."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>Then came the answer, which was more
convincing than surprising&mdash;"Because, my
dear Sir, we can't get an audience!"</p>

Our Dear <i>Daily News</i>, in a recent note, says
that the "Hôtel Magnifique" (as it ought to
be called, reminding us as the D. <i>D. N.</i>
justly observes of the <i>Hôtel Splendide</i> in
Paris) has been already styled by its proprietors
<i>The Cecil</i>. "The Cecil!"&mdash;"There
is only one in it," observes bluntly a certain
well-known comedian, quoting the song
"<i>There's only one in it, that's me!</i>" And
pleased is <span class="sc">Arthur Cecil</span> with the gratuitous
advertisement. But <i>The Cecil!</i> Good name
for club, not for hotel. <i>The Sarum</i> sounds

as "<i>The Mag.</i>" "<i>Omne ignotum pro magnifico.</i>"</p>

<h2>ANOTHER CONFERENCE OF WOMEN WORKERS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Not held at Nottingham.</i>)</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The garish but unsavoury "Saloon Bar" of a "South-side
Pub." A group of "Daughters of Toil" sipping and gossiping.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Laundress</i> (<i>throwing down newspaper</i>). Wot's this 'ere National
Union of Women Workers there's so much cackle about?</p>

<p><i>Step Girl</i> (<i>sullenly</i>). Dunno, I'm sure. <i>We</i>'re not in it,
anyhow.</p>

<p><i>Workman's Wife.</i> Ho no! <i>We</i> ain't women workers, I suppose,
<i>we</i> ain't!</p>

<p><i>Laundress.</i> Then I should like ter know where they find 'em.
(<i>Sips "white satin" and sniffs.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Shop Girl</i> (<i>to Sempstress</i>). 'Ere Miss <span class="sc">Mivvins</span>, you're no
hand of a scholard, and know all erbout everythink. Wot <i>is</i> this Nottingham
Goose Fair, anyhow?</p>

<p><i>Sempstress.</i> Well, it is not a goose fair, exactly <span class="sc">Emma</span>&mdash;not in
the sense of the old song, at any rate. Seems to me it's a meeting of
ladies of title, who don't know what work is, to talk about women of
no title who have to do it. (<i>Sighs.</i>) But I suppose they mean well,
poor dears.</p>

<p><i>Young Machinist</i> (<i>pallid and cramped</i>). Well, Miss <span class="sc">Mivvins</span>,
no doubt as they do. But oh dear me, what good are they going to
do the likes of us? My knees crackle, my back aches, and my head
swims. Thanks, yes, I don't mind if I do. (<i>Drinks.</i>) Ah! that
warms and straightens one out a bit! But if, as you say, these
ladies don't know what work is, one of 'em should do <i>my</i> little bit
at the warehouse for a week.</p>

<p><i>Laundress.</i> Ah! or mine, at the wash-tub.</p>

<p><i>Workman's Wife.</i> Or mine at the wash-tub <i>and</i> all over the shop
as well, as I 'olds is the 'ardest of all, seeing as how it ain't <i>never</i>
done.</p>

<p><i>Sempstress</i> (<i>mildly</i>). Ah, yes; but you have <i>your</i> husband and
children for company, whereas I&mdash;&mdash;Oh, the long, dreary loneliness
of it!</p>

<p><i>Tailoress.</i> Lookee 'ere, Liz, don't you talk about the old man
being <i>cumpny</i>, not till you know wot sich "cumpny" is. <i>You</i>
never got a black heye like this; and do you 'appen to know
'ow a kick from a 'obnailed 'ighlow feels in the ribs?</p>

<p><i>Sempstress</i> (<i>gently</i>). Well, no, my poor soul; and perhaps
I'm ungrateful to grumble.</p>

<p><i>Flower Mounter.</i> Yes; but what might these topping
Nottingham Lydy-Workers talk about when they <i>do</i> meet?</p>

<p><i>Sempstress.</i> Well, you see&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Laundress.</i> 'Old 'ard a minnit, <span class="sc">Liz</span>. Before you begin,
let's drink up and 'ave another all round. Torkin' 's dry
work, as I dessay the Nottingham spouters found it.</p>

<p class="rindent">[<i>They toss off, and replenish.</i></p>

<p><i>Sempstress</i> (<i>continuing</i>). Well, I see, one of their papers
is on "The Ethics of Work."</p>

<p><i>Step Girl.</i> Lor! wot's that, Miss <span class="sc">Mivvins</span>?</p>

<p><i>Sempstress</i> (<i>hesitating</i>). Well&mdash;you see&mdash;I suppose it
means the <i>morals</i> of work, or something o' that.</p>

<p><i>Laundress.</i> <i>Morals</i> of work! Might as well talk o' the
morals of misery while you 're erbout it. The less I 'ave to
do, the better I like it&mdash;that's <i>my</i> moral.</p>

<p><i>Shop Girl.</i> Not much morals about work nowadays,
<span class="sc">Sarah</span>, if <i>I</i>'m any judge. Piling up work and cutting down
prices, with the halternative of the streets if yer strikes&mdash;that's
about the "morals" of <i>our</i> firm. And if you torked to
our Boss about these 'ere Nottingham notions, <i>'e</i>'d "moral"
you!</p>

<p><i>Semptress.</i> Another lady, I see, with <i>such</i> a pretty, poetic-like
sort of name, talks about "The Responsibility of Refinement."</p>

<p><i>Workman's Wife.</i> Ah, well, we ain't got none, so that
can't consarn us, can it?</p>

<p><i>Shop Girl</i> (<i>tartly</i>). I say, you speak for yerself, Mother
<span class="sc">Matthews</span>. Of course, that means refinement in <i>dress</i>,
and&mdash;well we don't <i>all</i> wear a pancake 'at with a 'aporth
o' green feathers dobbed on to it! (<i>Sniffs, and adjusts
her own "high-up" hat with ambitious "hortridge"
plumes.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Workman's Wife</i> (<i>sharply</i>). Now look you 'ere, Miss
<span class="sc">Stuckup</span>, if I 'adn't more "refinement" in my little finger
than wot you 'ave in your 'ole five foot nothink, my old
man 'ud swop me off for a ragman's black doll, 'e would, so
there!</p>

<p><i>Voice from the Bar.</i> Now then lydies, a <i>leetle</i> less noise
there <i>if</i> you please!</p>

<p><i>Sempstress.</i> I see here's another talks of "Home Life,"
and another of the "Morals of Money Spending."</p>

<p><i>Workman's Wife.</i> Haw! haw! haw! Morals o' money
spending, indeed! If these 'ere torky lydies 'ad got as little
money to spend as <i>we</i> 'ave, and as many mouths to fill with
it, 'tisn't the <i>morals</i> on it as 'ud trouble 'em. When the
wealthy 'uns begin to patter of morals to us poor trash, they mostly
mean <i>meanness</i>, I reckon.</p>

<p><i>Young Machinist.</i> Right you are, Mrs. <span class="sc">Matthews</span>!</p>

<p><i>Sempstress</i> (<i>sadly</i>). And as to "Home Life,"&mdash;ah! how many of
them know that to some of us it only means a painful "Home

<p><i>Laundress.</i> Oh, come, I sy, Miss <span class="sc">Mivvens</span>, you'll give us all the

<h2>"THE 'PINERIAN' SPRING" AT THE COMEDY.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/215a-800.png"><img src="images/215a-180.png" width="180" height="323" alt="Mr. P-n-ro (making up after the portrait of Ibsen)." /></a>
<p><i>Mr. P-n-ro</i> (<i>making up after the portrait of Ibsen</i>).
"Ah! I think I'm getting uncommonly like him."</p></div>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Pinero</span> is temporarily Ibsenised. "<i>What will become of
them?</i>" should have been the sub-title, if not the single title, of his
new play at the "C. C. C.," or <span class="sc">Comyns Carr's</span> Comedy Theatre.
Instead of "<i>What will become of them?</i>" Mr. <span class="sc">Pinero</span>
calls it <i>The Benefit of the Doubt</i>, which is supposed to
be a quotation from the Judge's summing up in the Divorce Court
in the case of <i>Allingham</i> v. <i>Allingham</i>. <i>Mrs. Allingham</i>
has sued for a divorce in consequence of her husband's misconduct
with <i>Mrs. Fraser</i>; the misconduct was not proved, but the Judge was
so severe on the conduct of <i>Mrs. Fraser</i> that there is for
her, as far as her husband, friends, family, and Society generally are
concerned, no benefit whatever to be obtained from the existence of the
doubt in question. Such is the cheerful subject Mr. <span class="sc">Pinero</span>,
in Ibsenitish vein, has chosen, and he has
written a series of dramatic scenes artistically developing his
characters by the most natural dialogue possible, but not, as it
seems to me, by means either most natural, or most probable. The
great situation of the piece is brought about by a gentleman (in the
best sense of the word, as far as we can judge up to this point) permitting
his infernally jealous wife&mdash;there is no other epithet for her
except "infernally"&mdash;to conceal herself on purpose to overhear a
conversation between himself and her supposed rival! Analogous
situations in broad farce and farcical comedy are frequent and permissible:
but surely not in a drama of real life. But then, I remind
me, that this drama is Ibsenitish; which does make a difference.</p>

<p>The play is far too long, but it is admirably written and admirably
acted. The dramatist intends most of his leading characters to be
repulsively sordid, vulgar, and selfish, and those who are not so are
amiable, but weak. The first heroine, perfectly played by Miss
<span class="sc">Winifrid Emery</span>, is a fast member of a fast family as badly
brought up as <i>La famille Benoîton</i>, the vain, frivolous mother
being well portrayed by Miss <span class="sc">Lindley</span>; and the second heroine,
admirably represented by Miss <span class="sc">Lily Hanbury</span>, is simply an odious,
jealous shrew, and the prospect of happiness in a "place unmentionable
to ears polite" would be more probable than any happiness for a
husband with a wife like this. With neither heroine is sympathy
possible. Another splendid comedy performance is that of Miss
<span class="sc">Rose Leclercq</span>, as the Bishop's wife, a character whose original is
to be found in <span class="sc">Anthony Trollope's</span> <i>Barchester Towers</i>, from
which I will quote a specimen passage, and ask those who have seen
<i>The Benefit of the Doubt</i> whether it does not sum up in brief Mr.
<span class="sc">Pinero's</span> characters of <i>Mrs. Cloys</i> and her husband the Bishop:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"What did you say about it, Bishop?" asks <i>Mrs. Proudie</i> of her husband.</p>

<p>"Why," replies "her little man," "I said that I thought that if, that is,
should I&mdash;should the dean die&mdash;that is, I said I thought&mdash;&mdash;" As he went
on stammering and floundering, he saw that his wife's eye was fixed sternly
on him.
</p></blockquote>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;"><a href="images/215b-540.png"><img src="images/215b-130.png" width="130" height="343" alt="'Bedad then, 'tis Misther Shawn Allingham!'" /></a>
<p>"Bedad then, 'tis Misther Shawn Allingham!"</p></div>

<p>And these, with the stage directions, are the <i>Right Rev. Dr.
Cloys</i> and <i>Mrs. Cloys</i> of "St. Olpherts," and not of
"Barchester"&mdash;that's
all. And this <i>Mrs. Proudie-Cloys</i> serves as a <i>Dea ex
machinâ</i> coming forward to offer temporary relief to the hard,
austere husband <i>Mr. Fraser</i> (also a good performance by Mr. <span class="sc">J. G.
Grahame</span>), from his very trying wife. The Bishop is, oddly enough,
a mere "lay" figure; and is "left till called for" at the last moment.</p>

<p>Having already said that the acting all round is of first-class
quality, it will be superfluous to single out Mr. <span class="sc">Leonard Boyne</span> for
special praise. Yet he deserves it. Had the author given this
character an Irish title, the combination would have been perfect.
Mr. <span class="sc">Cyril Maude</span>, as the fussy, empty-headed M.P., adds another
finished picture to his eccentric portraitures; but Mr. <span class="sc">Pinero</span> might
have refrained from adding to this personage's eccentricities one
which originated with Mr. <span class="sc">Charles Wyndham's</span> <i>Headless Man</i>,
whose system of <i>memoria technica</i>,
and recalling things by initial letters, Mr. <span class="sc">Pinero</span> seems
to have borrowed, in order to complete <i>Sir Fletcher Portwood's</i>
equipment for the stage. It is as well to note this, lest
by unconscious cerebration Mr. <span class="sc">Pinero</span> should, in some future
piece, develope <i>Sir Fletcher</i> into another <i>Mr. Hedley</i>, and
refer to <i>Sir Fletcher</i> in this piece as his original.</p>

<p>The only pleasant scene is where, in the Second Act, two
club "pals," <i>Denzil Shafto</i> (Mr. <span class="sc">J. W. Pigott</span>) and <i>Peter
Elphick</i> (Mr. <span class="sc">Stuart Champion</span>) appear, the latter with a banjo;
both coming to cheer up their unhappy friend <i>Misther Allingham</i>.
These two lighten up the gloom of the Second Act for a
brief space, and then are heard no more; yet the scene in
which they strut their short ten minutes on the stage is
one of the best imagined, and best stage-managed as regards
"business," in a piece where every detail has been considered
and not a point lost. For acting, for dialogue, for character (granting
these to be what the author of their being has made them),
this unpleasant play ranks with the best of the dramas from,
what <i>Mrs. Malaprop</i> might term, "The Pinerian spring."
And the end? Nothing; a blank. The audience look at one
another and say, "Well&mdash;and then?... What next?" It
is a highly-finished play without a finish. It belongs to the
new order of dramas classified under the heading of the "The
Problem Play." Whether these will pay, or not, is another problem
of which the author and manager may find a satisfactory solution.</p>

<h2 class="sans">HOW KIPPER SLEW THE NEW FOREST HORNET.</h2>

<p class="title1"><span class="sc">Chapter II.</span>&mdash;<i>The Rescue.</i></p>

<p>For what length of time <span class="sc">Kipper</span> and the stagbeetle remained in
the unwonted positions described in the preceding chapter it would
be impossible to say without a stop-watch, which makes a good
repeater. However, it is certain that a couple of snails out for a
stroll, who saw the fall from the bottom of the heap, tried to come to
their help; but, owing to gout, they were unable to get more than half-way
up. A neighbouring mole heard the stagbeetle's smothered cries,
but, being blind, scuttled off in the wrong direction; while an old-fashioned
toad, who lived in a mud-bank just opposite, was aroused
from an afternoon nap, and, after peering out of his hole, declared that
it was no business of his. But then he was always hard-hearted,
and had made it a point never to interfere in the affairs of others
ever since he was out-voted in the
Zoological County Council on the
question as to whether tadpoles
should be recognised as young
frogs. He was opposed to the
measure, stating, in a powerful
speech, that inasmuch as a frog
had no tail, therefore a tadpole
could not be a frog. Being defeated,
he retired into private life,
and was, so report said, building a
home for destitute dormice, for he
was a person of considerable wealth.
But he was very mean, and a shrew
was heard to observe that the reason
he wished to take the dormice under
his protection was because they ate
nothing in the winter.</p>

<p>But while we are discussing
politics <span class="sc">Kipper</span> and the stagbeetle
are still in danger. Although the
stagbeetle kicked with all his
might he found that it only injured
his horns, and so, like many
other creatures not of a gambling
nature, lay still and trusted to
chance. As to <span class="sc">Kipper</span>, he was as motionless as a schoolboy's watch.
But about a quarter-of-an-hour after the accident a pretty young
maiden, named <span class="sc">Eglantine</span>, came tripping along the road. She was
not one of those girls who know that they are nice, because no one had
ever told her so, and she was too poor to afford a looking-glass.
But this did not prevent her from being good to all the inhabitants
of the forest, whether they had four legs, or two, or none at all, as
was the case with the snakes and blind worms. Yet the best of us
must have enemies, and she had incurred the anger of <span class="sc">Nippard</span>, the
great and poisonous hornet, whose only pleasure, like that of some
people who have guns, was to go out and kill something. <span class="sc">Eglantine</span>
had saved two lambs once from his murderous attacks by driving
them into an out-house, and <span class="sc">Nippard</span> had never forgotten or forgiven
the insult, and vowed vengeance. This he had carried out in
several ways. He had stung <span class="sc">Eglantine's</span> goat to death, killed her
pet dog, and so tortured a brood of chickens belonging to her
widowed mother, that they had imagined themselves to be ducklings
and were drowned in a pond.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/216-980.png"><img src="images/216-400.png" width="400" height="310" alt="'Here we are again!'" /></a>
<p class="center">"Here we are again!"</p></div>

<p>These troubles caused great grief to <span class="sc">Eglantine</span> and her parent,
and ruin stared them in the face; and, when ruin stares, there is
not often a back way out of the difficulty. Very sad, therefore, was
the poor girl as she approached the place of <span class="sc">Kipper's</span> disaster. But
directly she saw what had happened she forgot all her own troubles,
and, with many words of pity, extricated the stagbeetle from the
stones. The insect was so pleased, that he wished to embrace her:
but stagbeetles kiss, like Laplanders, by rubbing noses; so <span class="sc">Eglantine</span>
declined the offer, and hurried to pick up the luckless <span class="sc">Kipper</span>,
with whom she had a bowing acquaintance. In her case, therefore,
familiarity had never bred contempt for his sulky ways. She was
really sorry to see the poor fellow in such dreadful plight, and took
him up, as tenderly as she would have a butterfly with a broken leg.
Then she laid him on the soft grass, and sent the stagbeetle to
get some wild mint while she loosened his waistcoat, and gently
fanned his face with a dock-leaf. When the mint arrived, she
crushed the fragrant leaves between her fingers, and made him
inhale the scent, still keeping up
the fanning.</p>

<p>In two or three minutes <span class="sc">Kipper</span>
gave two or three sobs, shook himself
like a dog who has been in the
water, and, sitting up, opened his
eyes, and exclaimed, "Here we
are again!" He had come to himself,
for he could have gone to
nobody else. Then he looked at
<span class="sc">Eglantine</span> with a curious sort of
smile, which made her blush, and
cried, "So you have saved my life.
What reward do you expect?"</p>

<p><span class="sc">Eglantine</span> blushed again, and
the stagbeetle gave his master a
gentle pinch and whispered that
there had been no time to advertise
their misfortune in the <i>Gossamer
Gazette</i>, which is the official organ
of Fairydom. <span class="sc">Kipper</span> took the
hint and in a milder tone said,
"Well, <span class="sc">Eglantine</span>, you have done
me a good turn. Why did you do
so?" "O! Mr. <span class="sc">Kipper</span>," replied
the maiden; "was it not my duty?"
"It is a bad habit," replied the goblin, "to try and answer
one question with another, but it is an excellent but rare custom to
try and repay one favour with another. Can I be of any use to you?
Think before you answer." "Why should I," said <span class="sc">Eglantine</span>;
"are you not a fellow-creature?" "A fellow-creature!" screamed
<span class="sc">Kipper</span>. "Don't you know that I am a goblin, a mischievous
goblin, a good-for-nothing goblin?" "O! no," answered <span class="sc">Eglantine</span>,
simply; "I only know that you have the right to be made
happy, as has every creature on earth." <span class="sc">Kipper</span> leapt to his feet.
His queer little face seemed suddenly freed from wrinkles, there was
something like a dew drop in each corner of his eyes. "Why,
<span class="sc">Eglantine</span>," he shouted; "you are a perfect &mdash;&mdash;" It has never
been known whether he would have added "donkey" or "angel,"
because at this minute a fierce trumpeting rent the air, <span class="sc">Eglantine</span>
shrieked, the stagbeetle quivered, even <span class="sc">Kipper</span> turned pale, for
just above them hovered a great tawny and black creature, with
fierce hate in its glowing eyes: in short, <span class="sc">Nippard</span> the Terror of the
Forest!</p>

<span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A corridor in the Royal Courts.</i> Eminent Counsel <i>in conversation

<p><i>Client.</i> I am rather sorry, Sir, that you could not conduct my case
in person.</p>

<p><i>Coun.</i> So am I. I took a deal of trouble in preparing the argument
I proposed to advance, and it was a great disappointment to me
that I was unable to deliver it in person.</p>

<p><i>Solic.</i> But your junior, Sir, represented you to perfection.</p>

<p><i>Coun.</i> I am rejoiced to hear it. I give every credit to my young
and learned friend, and am pleased to think that when we met in
consultation I was able to choose the right line of policy.</p>

<p><i>Solic.</i> Besides, if you were not with us, your retainer prevented you
from being against us. And that was a distinct advantage.</p>

<p><i>Coun.</i> You are most flattering, and too kind.</p>

<p><i>Solic.</i> Not at all; and I am sure my client agrees with me?</p>

<p><i>Client.</i> Well, of course I would rather have had the assistance of
silk, although your junior no doubt did his best.</p>

<p><i>Coun.</i> I am sure he did. And now, gentlemen, is there anything
further I can do for you?</p>

<p><i>Solic.</i> Thank you very much&mdash;I think not. You got up your case,
consulted with your junior, and if you were prevented from putting
in an appearance in the Court itself, were there in spirit. Besides, I
repeat it was a good thing for us that you did not join the Bar of the
other side. Thank you very much indeed, Sir. Good day.</p>

<p><i>Coun.</i> Good day. (<i>He prepares to walk off, when, noticing a
movement of the solicitor, he stops.</i>) You are sure I can do nothing
more for you?</p>

<p><i>Solic.</i> Oh, it's scarcely worth mentioning. But perhaps you
would not mind returning your fee.</p>

<p><i>Coun.</i> With the greatest pleasure! (<i>Hands over a bag of gold
and exit.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Client.</i> Well, really, that seems to me very generous! Isn't it
rather unusual?</p>

<p><i>Solic.</i> Unusual! Oh dear no! Why, it's the practice of the
whole profession!</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
